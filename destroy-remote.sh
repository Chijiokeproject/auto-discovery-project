‚ùó Could not remove bucket automatically. Common reasons:
  - The bucket is versioned (has object versions/delete markers).
  - Bucket is in a different region/profile.
  - Network/permission issues.

Next steps (simplest):
  1) If the bucket is versioned, ask me and I'll create a detailed remover that deletes all versions.
  2) Or inspect contents manually:
       aws --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region $AWS_REGION s3api list-object-versions --bucket $BUCKET_NAME

If you'd like, I can provide a safe detailed remover that deletes all versions and markers (it requires more permissions).
